# Problems Solver Challenges

### Overview
This is the compiled list of programming problems and challenges I've found and solved.
My intention is that it would become a useful resource for studying, reviewing and practicing
for any technical interviews or just for the sake of solving new programming challenges.

My advice is to try solving the problems by yourself first before start looking at the solutions.
Most of the problems will be accompanied by test cases/unit tests for your convenience.

### Choice of Programming Languages
Currently, I only add solutions/method stubs and unit tests for javascript because
it has the simplest setup and light-weight among other languages.

I'm planning to add more as I have more times adding in.

#### Javascript
You need
```
Node.js installed on your machine
```

To complie and execute the js file, type the following command 
and replace YOUR_FILE_NAME.js with your javascript file and press enter
```
node YOUR_FILE_NAME.js
```
